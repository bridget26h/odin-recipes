            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled brown butter, brown sugar and white sugar, whisking until combined. Add the egg, egg yolk and vanilla. Mix well. Add the flour, baking soda and salt, folding until just combined . Carefully fold in the chocolate and toffee pieces.</li>
            <li>Allow the dough to chill for at least an hour or overnight.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 350°F  and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. Scoop out the cookies using a 1 ounce cookie scoop and place the balls 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until the edges are golden brown, but the center is still gooey. Allow to cool before devouring!</li>
